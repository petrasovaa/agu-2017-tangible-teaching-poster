We developed and tested a new method for teaching hydrology, geomorphology,
and grading using Tangible Landscape\,---\,a tangible interface for geospatial modeling.
Tangible Landscape couples a physical and digital model of a landscape through
a real-time cycle of hands-on modeling, 3D scanning, geospatial computation,
and projection [1].
With Tangible Landscape students can: %sculpt a projection-augmented
% topographic model of a landscape with their hands and use a variety of tangible objects
% to immediately see how they are changing geospatial analytics such as contours, profiles,
% water flow, or landform types. By feeling and manipulating the shape of the topography,
% while seeing projected geospatial analytics, students can intuitively learn about 3D topographic form,
% its representations, and how topography controls physical processes.
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5cm]

\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.83\linewidth]{./images/TL_Setup}
\end{center}

Tangible Landscape powered by GRASS GIS [2],
an open source platform with extensive libraries for geospatial modeling,
can be flexibly programmed to accommodate simple to complex
geospatial applications and simulations, thus providing a
broader range of teaching opportunities than preceding geospatial tangible user interfaces (TUI).
% Tangible Landscape is powered by GRASS GIS, an open source geospatial platform with extensive libraries
% for geospatial modeling and analysis. As such, Tangible Landscape can be used to design a wide range
% of learning experiences across a large number of geoscience disciplines.

% Understanding topography and its representations is crucial for correct interpretation and modeling of surface processes. However, novice earth science and landscape architecture students often find reading topographic maps challenging. As a result, many students struggle to comprehend more complex spatial concepts and processes such as flow accumulation or sediment transport.
% 
% As part of a graduate level course that teaches grading, 16 students participated in a series of workshops, which were developed as serious games to encourage learning through structured play. These serious games included 1) diverting rain water to a specified location with minimal changes to landscape, 2) building different combinations of landforms, and 3) reconstructing landscapes based on projected contour information with feedback.
% In this poster, we will introduce Tangible Landscape, and describe the games and their implementation. We will then present preliminary results of a user experience survey we conducted as part of the workshops. All developed materials and software are open source and available online.

 \item[Goal ]
 Test the effectiveness of a tangible teaching method\,---\,implemented with Tangible Landscape\,---\,for
 teaching concepts of grading, geomorphology, and hydrology.
 \item[Subjects ] 16 graduate students from a Landform and Grading course in the Department of Landscape Architecture
%  participated in three sessions
\item[Assessment]~\\%We assessed the effectiveness of Tangible Landscape as a teaching tool through: 
\vspace{-1.5em}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5cm]
 \item[\textbullet{} ] Usability and user experience (UX) survey designed and validated for geospatial TUIs
 
 \item[\textbullet{} ] Three assessments administered before and after workshops to assess acquisition
 and transfer of spatial skills: topographic map assessment (TMA) and  two assessments specific to landforms and cut \& fill tasks
%  \item[\textbullet{} ] topographic map assessment (TMA) to assess acquisition and transfer of spatial skills

\item[Results ]
Findings provide evidence that Tangible Landscape supports 
improved UX and marginal, task-specific knowledge building.
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5cm]
 \item[\textbullet{} ] The objects' physicality enabled
participants to effectively interact with the system,
positively impacting ratings of the system's usability and UX.
\item[\textbullet{} ] No significant response accuracy differences found for TMA nor landform assessment,
potentially due to mismatched psychometric properties of tangible (3D)
teaching methods with 2D assessments of learning outcomes.
 \item[\textbullet{} ] Students scored significantly better on the cut and fill assessment after workshop, in comparison to before.
\end{itemize}
